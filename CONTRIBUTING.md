# Contributing

All kinds of contributions to Dotbot are greatly appreciated. For someone
unfamiliar with the code base, the most efficient way to contribute is usually
to submit a [feature request](#feature-requests) or [bug report](#bug-reports).
If you want to dive into the source code, you can submit a [patch](#patches) as
well, either working on your own ideas or [existing issues][issues].

## Feature Requests

Do you have an idea for an awesome new feature for Dotbot? Please [submit a
feature request][issue]. It's great to hear about new ideas.

If you are inclined to do so, you're welcome to [fork][fork] Dotbot, work on
implementing the feature yourself, and submit a patch. In this case, it's
_highly recommended_ that you first [open an issue][issue] describing your
enhancement to get early feedback on the new feature that you are implementing.
This will help avoid wasted efforts and ensure that your work is incorporated
into the code base.

## Bug Reports

Did something go wrong with Dotbot? Sorry about that! Bug reports are greatly
appreciated!

When you [submit a bug report][issue], please include relevant information such
as Dotbot version, operating system, configuration file, error messages, and
steps to reproduce the bug. The more details you can include, the easier it is
to find and fix the bug.

## Patches

Want to hack on Dotbot? Awesome!

If there are [open issues][issues], you're more than welcome to work on those -
this is probably the best way to contribute to Dotbot. If you have your own
ideas, that's great too! In that case, before working on substantial changes to
the code base, it is _highly recommended_ that you first [open an issue][issue]
describing what you intend to work on.

**Patches are generally submitted as pull requests.** Patches are also
[accepted over email][email].

Any changes to the code base should follow the style and coding conventions
used in the rest of the project. The version history should be clean, and
commit messages should be descriptive and [properly
formatted][commit-messages]. It's recommended that you add unit tests to
demonstrate that the bug is fixed (or that the feature works).

See the [Dotbot development guide][development] to learn how to run the tests,
type checking, and more.
